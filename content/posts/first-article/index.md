Some of the things you may find in this blog.

<!--more-->

I recently found a page in my Notion where I stored some of the things I wrote in moments of great inspiration. Most of them are just an orderless collection of words and thoughts that crossed my mind at that given moment. 

Some of them seem to be going somewhere interesting but where cut right before the moment of illumination where I might have felt inspired to write something amazing. 

And very few of them have some profound and compelling ideas that even I was surprised to find my past self was capable of writing. 

The idea of this blog (as well was motivated by my girlfriend, to "find a hobby" and such) is to have a way to store and share these ideas. Mostly to my future self, but also to anyone who might be interested.

Disclaimer: now that I have decided to put these ideas out there, you should know that english is not my native language. There will be many kinds of errors. But that's kind of the point as well, to improve and overcome the fear of being judged. As I will be either way.
