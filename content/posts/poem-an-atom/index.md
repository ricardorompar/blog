An atom in the universe, a universe of atoms. Where my subtitle comes from.

<!--more-->

In the fall of 1955, physicist and Nobel laureate, Richard Feynman imparted a lecture in the National Academy of Sciences named "The Value of Science". On it he addressed the importance of scientific knowledge and how it empowers the human race to do great things. But he also emphasized that it doesn't dictate how that power should be used.

Feynman was an outstanding scientist, a remarkable teacher and communicator and as if that was not enough he was also a great artist. 

As part of that lecture in 1955 he merged the depth of his scientific mind with the elegance of poetry to beautifully describe the origin and experience of being conscious:

> _[...] I stand at the seashore, alone, and start to think._
>
> _There are the rushing waves_ \
> _mountains of molecules_ \
> _each stupidly minding its own business_ \
> _trillions apart_ \
> _yet forming white surf in unison._
> 
> _Ages on ages before any eyes could see_ \
> _year after year_ \
> _thunderously pounding the shore as now._ 
> 
> _For whom, for what?_
> 
> _On a dead planet_ \
> _with no life to entertain_
> 
> _Never at rest_ \
> _tortured by energy_ \
> _wasted prodigiously by the sun_ \
> _poured into space._
> 
> _A mite makes the sea roar._
> 
> _Deep in the sea_ \
> _all molecules repeat_ \
> _the patterns of one another_ \
> _the complex new ones are formed._ \
> _They make others like themselves_ \
> _and a new dance starts._
> 
> _Growing in size and complexity_ \
> _living things_ \
> _masses of atoms_ \
> _DNA, protein_ \
> _dancing a pattern ever more intricate._
> 
> _Out of the cradle_ \
> _onto dry land_ \
> _here it is_ \
> _standing:_ \
> _atoms with consciousness;_ \
> _matter with curiosity._
> 
> _Stands at the sea,_ \
> _wonders at wondering: I_ \
> _a univers of atoms_ \
> _an atom in the universe._

For all we know, we might be the only entity in the universe that has the ability to "wonder at wondering".

Intelligence emerged throughout millions of years of evolution, from the very ingredients that make up stars, rocks, air and water. And we have ended up here, contemplating our own existence. Consciousness. 

At the verge of becoming not only the spectators of your own intelligence but the artisans of an artificial one.

What a time to be alive.
