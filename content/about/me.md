Hi there! I'm Ricardo, an engineer, friend, brother, son and soon to be husband. This blog is the result of a series of experiments I'm conducting to discover what it means to be me.

I have a [website](https://ricardorompar.com) where I put my resume and some of the projects I've worked on if you'd like to check that out.
